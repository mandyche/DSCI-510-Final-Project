# DSCI-510-Final-Project
Hello! Welcome to my research project about discovering the correlational relationship between weather, financial news, and stock performance. In this project, my ultimate goal is to investigate the potential relationship between financial news sentiment, weather patterns, and stock performance. I scraped all of 2023 BBC business news title and put them into chatgpt asking for the impact rating (if there are 7 news that day, 4 out of 7 news titles considered as positive, then the overall rating for the news during that day is rated as positive). I also simplified the weather rating into rainy and sunny only. If the weather that day is not rainy(cloudy or partly cloudy), it is considered as sunny. By analyzing these datasets and compare with SPY stock performance, I hope I could provide valuable insights for investors and analysts in understanding market dynamics.
